  problem: [
    Compensatory theological formulations frequently lack a coherent hermeneutical bridge when addressing contemporary scientific models in local pastoral leadership. This study investigates the extent to which pastoral integrative competency influences congregational resilience during faith-science controversies.
  ],
  method: [
    A mixed-methods empirical design was employed. Thirty-six pastoral practitioners and 124 church leaders across North America participated in semi-structured qualitative interviews and quantitative evaluative assessments over a two-year longitudinal observation period.
  ],
  results: [
    Significant variance was observed in pastoral confidence and constructive dialogue across educational backgrounds ($p < .01$). Integrative leadership training correlated positively with congregational health and retention of young adults during contentious scientific debates.
  ],
  conclusions: [
    Methodological clarity regarding the distinct domains of biblical revelation and empirical inquiry is essential for effective 21st-century ministry. An integrative pastoral curriculum equips leaders to facilitate constructive, faith-affirming dialogue.

#preface-page(title: auto)[
  This dissertation represents an effort to bridge the conceptual gap between theological education and empirical scientific developments. The motivation for this research stems from pastoral experiences where parishioners sought biblically faithful yet intellectually robust answers to complex contemporary questions.

  I express profound gratitude to my project advisor, Dr. John A. Smith, whose rigorous mentorship shaped this research, and to the faculty of the Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary at Andrews University.

#heading(level: 3)[The Limits \ of Science]

Science and religion are arguably the two most powerful forces in human culture. The nature of relations between these forces has been explored and debated for millennia @calvin1960. This dissertation continues that exploration and debate. This first chapter introduces the dissertation in terms of its (1) problem and purpose, (2) problem justification, (3) methodology, and (4) delimitations @knight2001.

For Langdon Gilkey, science and theology are "mutually interdependent" with regard to relations between their types of truth:

#blockquote[
  For both science and religion . . . the question of the relation of each to reality, of the truth each holds, is crucial---for both essentially represent a relation to reality that is cognitive or believed to be so. And thus, because science and religion are mutually interdependent, the issues of the truth of science and the truth of religion and of the relations between these sorts of truth represent fundamental concerns for each. @gilkey1989[p. 11]
]

Now that Gilkey's view of science has been surveyed, the nature of his model for theology and, therefore, for the use of empirical inquiry must be carefully delineated @canale2005.

// Level 3 subhead (left margin, bold, title case) — per Exhibit I: "The Nature of Theology"

Seventh-day Adventist theology has maintained a dynamic posture toward scientific developments while upholding the authority of Scripture @andrews2024. In the historical evolution of Adventist higher education, tensions and synthesis were frequently observed @gc1995[p. 112].

The empirical phase of the research gathered data on ministerial student preferences regarding DMin coursework flexibility and mentoring support.

  #heading(level: 2)[Ministerial Integration Survey Instrument]

  The following questionnaire was administered to pastoral leaders participating in the DMin research cohort. All responses were collected anonymously.

  1. How often do scientific or faith-science questions arise in your pastoral counseling and preaching?

  2. What hermeneutical models do you find most helpful when addressing cross-disciplinary topics?
